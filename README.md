# Need is fulfilled

This file is created to fulfill the need of being actively present on mid-nights and save the model weights and log files before restarting of the Nvidia Server (having time limit of 9 hrs) on which I am training and testing my research-models.
I would like to say , it is worth setting up the automation.
